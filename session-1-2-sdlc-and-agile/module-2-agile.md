## Module 2: Agile Methodology – Principles and Implementation

---

### **1. Introduction to Agile**

* What is Agile?
  → A mindset, not a process. Agile is about **iterative development**, **fast feedback**, and **responding to change**.

* The Agile Manifesto
  **4 Core Values**:

    * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    * Working software over comprehensive documentation
    * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    * Responding to change over following a plan

* **12 Agile Principles**

    * Flexibility
    * Early feedback
    * Collaboration
    * Continuous improvement

| Development Team | Builds the product                         | Engineers developing login and notes API |

---

### **5. Scrum Artifacts**

* **Product Backlog** → Master list of all features
* **Sprint Backlog** → Features committed for the sprint
* **Increment** → Working product at end of sprint

---

### **6. Scrum Events / Ceremonies**

| Event                | Frequency       | Purpose                      |

### **7. User Stories**

* Format:
  *“As a \[user], I want to \[do something], so that \[I get value].”*

    * Example: “As a user, I want to add tags to notes, so I can organize my thoughts better.”

* **Acceptance Criteria** and **Definition of Done**

---

### **Agile Implementation Activity:**

* Split into teams, write at least **5 user stories** for the notebook app
* Define acceptance criteria
* Plan a 5-day sprint to deliver MVP features (login, add note, edit note, view notes)

### By End of Agile Module, Learners Will Be Able To:

* Explain Agile values and principles
* Understand and operate within a Scrum team
* Break down features into user stories
* Conduct agile ceremonies (stand-ups, retrospectives)
* Plan and execute a sprint with real business goals
