## **Module 1: Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

---

### **1. What is SDLC?**

* Definition and purpose
* Real-life analogy (e.g., constructing a house)
* Importance in building robust, maintainable software

### **2. SDLC Phases with Real-World Examples**

| Phase                 | Key Activities                                         | Example in Notebook App                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Requirement Gathering | Stakeholder meetings, user stories, scope finalization | What features should the notebook have? Login, notes, tags, etc. |
| Design                | Architecture, technology stack, UI wireframes          | Decide to use Spring Boot + PostgreSQL + Angular                 |
| Implementation        | Actual coding                                          | Writing APIs for user, note, tag                                 |
| Testing               | Unit, integration, and UAT                             | JUnit for APIs, Postman testing                                  |
| Deployment            | Moving to prod/staging                                 | Deploy app to GCP/Azure                                          |
| Maintenance           | Bug fixes, performance improvements                    | Add tagging feature later                                        |

### **3. Common SDLC Models**

* **Waterfall Model**

    * Sequential and rigid
    * Works well for well-defined projects (e.g., bank portals)

* **Agile Model**

    * Iterative, incremental
    * Suits modern, evolving projects (e.g., SaaS products)

### **4. SDLC in Agile Projects**

* SDLC still exists in Agile â€” but compressed into sprints
* Agile = faster feedback + continuous delivery

### **5. Why SDLC is Important**

* Aligns all stakeholders
* Predictable timelines and budgets
* Reduces technical debt
* Ensures quality through defined testing

---

### **Interactive Activity:**

* Break the class into groups to outline an SDLC for a fictional project (e.g., a Todo App or E-Commerce site)
* Groups present how each phase would look in their project

### By End of SDLC Module, Learners Will Be Able To:

* Explain SDLC phases and their relevance
* Differentiate between Waterfall and Agile workflows
* Map real-world examples to each SDLC phase
* Contribute to planning and requirement gathering discussions effectively
