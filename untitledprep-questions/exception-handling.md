You have to implement the concept of Exception Handling in Java. You will be given an expression containing two operators and an operand. The final task is to implement a simple calculator program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on two numbers.



You’ve been provided with a starter code which contains sub-tasks as defined below:

Task1: Throw an IllegalArgumentException with message "Invalid operation" if the input consists of more than three characters.

Task2: Perform the operations of the calculator using switch cases. Throw IllegalArgumentException with message "Invalid operation".

Task3: Throw arithmetic exception with message "Division by zero is not allowed" when the related case is encountered.

Task5: Print "ArithmeticException: Division by zero is not allowed." in relevant operation when the exception is encountered.

Task6: Print "IllegalArgumentException: Invalid operation." for cases where operations other than those supported by calculator are requested.

Task7: Use a finally block to close the scanner class.



Notes:



Do not remove the predefined code else your code may not execute as expected.
You’ve to solve the problem using the Exception Handling ONLY. Solving through any alternate method other than the Exception Handling may lead to disqualification.


Input Format

A string containing the described expression in a space separated format.



Output Format

The output displays the result obtained after performing the given calculator operation.
