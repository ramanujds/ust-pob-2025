Create a HTML page with an employee registration form
Problem Statement
You are required to create a HTML page with an employee registration form and validate the user input using JavaScript.



Tasks:



1. HTML Page with Basic Styling:

Create an HTML page that contains a registration form with the following input fields: Employee ID, Email, and Password, along with a Submit button.
The form should be styled as follows to make it visually appealing:
Use a calming background color for the page.
Center the registration form on the page.
Add padding and margins to the form elements for spacing.
Style the Submit button with a gradient background color, border-radius, and change its color when hovered over.
Ensure the input fields have a consistent and appealing design, with subtle borders and padding.


2. Input Validation with Stylish Feedback:

Implement the following input validation using JavaScript:
Employee ID: The Employee ID should only contain letters and numbers.
Email: The Email should be a valid email address.
Password: The Password should be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.
The feedback should be styled as follows:
Error messages should appear directly below the associated input field.
Style error messages with a red font color and ensure they are clearly visible against the background color of the page.
Highlight the borders of the input fields in red where the error occurs.


3. Form Submission with Success Styling:

If all the fields are valid, display a success message on the page: "Registration successful!"
Style the success message with a green font color and display it at the top of the registration form. Optionally, add a subtle green border or background to the success message for enhanced visibility.




Requirements:

The HTML page should load without any errors.
The registration form should be visible with the specified input fields and the Submit button.
The form elements should be spaced appropriately, and the design should be consistent and visually appealing.
Hovering over the Submit button should change its color.
Input validation should be performed on all fields.
Success message should displayed on valid submission.




Test Cases:

Submit the form with an empty Employee ID. The page should display an error message: "Employee ID is required."
Submit the form with an empty Email. The page should display an error message: "Email is required."
Submit the form with an empty Password. The page should display an error message: "Password is required."
Submit the form with an invalid Employee ID. The page should display an error message: "Employee ID can only contain letters and numbers."
Submit the form with an invalid Email. The page should display an error message: "Please enter a valid email address."
Submit the form with an invalid Password. The page should display an error message: "Password must be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character."
Submit the form with all valid input. The page should display a success message: "Registration successful!" This message should be styled appropriately and should be clearly visible.
